# PROJECT STRUCTURE GUIDE

## COMPONENT GUIDE

### 1. `components/ui` (shadcn)

- This folder is generated when importing components from **shadcn/ui**.
- Components here are already styled with Tailwind (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Dialog`...).
- **Do not edit directly**. If customization is needed, copy to `components/common`.

---

### 2. `components/common`

- Shared components that are reused across multiple features or pages.
- Examples: `ButtonCustom`, `FormInput`, `ModalConfirm`...

---

## FEATURES GUIDE

- Components and Pages for a **specific feature**.
- Example: `Counter.tsx` inside `./features/example-1/`.

---

## STORE GUIDE

The `store/` folder is where you put your state managers with Redux Toolkit.
Put your reducers under the sub-folder features in ./store/features/

## LIB GUIDE

The `lib/` folder contains shared utilities and helper functions that can be used across the whole application.
It helps keep the codebase clean and organized.

### 1.`lib/utils.ts`

- This file is **auto-generated by shadcn/ui** when installing components.
- Contains small utility functions used by shadcn components (e.g., `cn()` for merging Tailwind CSS classes).
- These functions are generic and can also be reused anywhere in the app.
- You can add more utilities here if needed.

### 2. `lib/axios.ts`

- Custom file created to manage **Axios configuration**.
- Defines a pre-configured `axiosInstance` with base URL, headers, and interceptors.
- Makes API calls consistent and easier to maintain.
- Instead of configuring Axios every time, you just import this file and use the instance.
